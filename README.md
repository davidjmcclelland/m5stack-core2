# m5stack-core2

## This repo contains a few UI-Flow project files that run on an M5 Stack Core 2 device. 

### mqtt2-Continuous.m5f will allow an M5-stack Core2 Device to report rotational data and possibly other telemetry via MQTT to a broker. 

### Configurable settings will be hard-coded or defaulted to known good values to work with EdgeX

### See [This blog series]("https://davidjmcclelland.com/?p=4966) to understand how this fits into a larger project involving creating a "Digital Twin".
